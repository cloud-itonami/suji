  "Muscle paths, and the two ways a straight-line model goes wrong.

  The calibration check is the important one: the offsets in `attachment/muscles`
  exist to reproduce, at the neutral posture, the constant moment arms this actor
  used before the anatomy existed. If someone edits an attachment and the neutral
  leverage moves, every %MVC this actor has ever reported silently changes meaning.
  That is what these pin."
